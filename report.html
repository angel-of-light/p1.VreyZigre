      <h1>Issues with current design</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">To start with, the design of the microwave looks old and outdated. The microwave does not have enough quick options to deliver. The only quick option button we have is the popcorn button. I think the users would appreciate more button in that regard. The button that opens the door of the microwave is not visible enough. It almost looks like it is hiding in the design. 
          <br> There is a button called index, and I am not sure what this button is for. The buttons under the screen do not have any indication on them. This design not very user friendly. We can see something called "Bookmark" except we do not know what this bookmark is for. This entire middle part is rather confusing.

          <br><br>
          When it comes to the settings that the microwave has to offer, though it does offer things like reheat, cook, potato, pizza etc, it has very unnecessary settings. It offers a special options like mushrooms, corn on a cob, peas, spinach, squash summer, squash winter, scrabble eggs, omelettes. Even though it took some effort to offer all these options, there are neither crucial nor necessary to the users most of the time. The list is just cumbersome and difficult to navigate for the user. 

          <br><br>
          The layout of the number is horizontal and has 2 rows of 5 numbers. This layout is outdated because most of the devices that we use do not have this layout and it might confusing to the users. A layout with 3 numbers per row will be better. 

          <br><br>
          <b>The most common use of a microwave are:<br> </b>
          - Popcorn <br>
          - Pizza <br>
          - Reheat <br>
          - Defrost <br>
          - Cook <br>
          - Potato <br><br> 

          <b>The least common use of a microwave are:<br></b> 
          - Corn on a cob <br> 
          - Spinach <br>
          - Squash summer <br> 
          - Squash winter <br> 
          - Scrabble eggs <br> 
          - Mushrooms <br> 
          <br> 

          The design of this microwave does not allow the user to have access to the most common options. 
          <br>
          Usually users select a quick option (one the most commonly used options), then select the time they want the microwave to work. 
          <br> <br>
          The current microwave does help in some way to support the user figure out how it works but as previously mentioned the options are too much and the users might feel overwhelmed. 
          <br> <br>
          The microwave provide a sound feedback to the user. 
          <br><br>The mistakes the user can make with the current design is to not find a way to open the door. The way the button that opens the door is hidden in the design makes it harder to even know it is. The layout of the numbers too can make the user type in the wrong numbers since they are used to a differrent layout from other devices.

      <h1>New Personal Design</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is the personal design I have made and this is how it solves the design mistakes encountered on the first microwave .</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">To start with, my new design replaces the door button but a handle. The chocie of the handle is clear because it is more visible, easy to grab and overall more ergonomic than the former button. 

        <br><br>

      Secondly, I have added a few button that talk about the earlier paragraphs have been added. Buttons such as Popcorn, Reheat, Cook, Defrost, Pizza, Potato. Those buttons are the most commonly used features by the users. 

      <br><br>

      The user receives feedback from haptic motors placed before the screen. So when they select an option on the touch screen, they will know it has been selected. 

      <br><br> 

      Finally, this designs helps people will disability through haptic feedback but also because of a voice assistant that is inegrated to the system (Alexa). This way, even someone blind can give a command such as "Alexa make popcorn", and after putting the popcorn bag in the microwave. It will be also easier for a person with disability to open the door of the microwave because of the handle on it.
